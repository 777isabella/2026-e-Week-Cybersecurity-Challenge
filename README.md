# 2026-e-Week-Cybersecurity-Challenge
Dr. Jose Poveda and Dr. Jorge Castillo, two cybersecurity professors at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley held a cybersecurity competition for all College of Engineering and COmputer Science students for the 2026 Enginee's-Week (E-Week). I participated in two out of three of these challenges designed by faculty, and I'm thrilled to say that I won first place for the 2nd challenge: Blockchain Project, and I won second place for the 1st project: Cryptanalysis Project. I had a lot of fun researching and working on these projects, and I'm very grateful for this recognition from Dr. Poveda and Dr. Castillo, and I look forward to nect year's cybersecurity challenge!
